                When playing in the forever fall forest with her younger brother in her childhood, they were attacked 
                by a grimm. It got her brother and she could only watch as it killed him. All her life she's been told
                to run away so she did, tears streaming down her face. But it seemed like she wasn't fast enough.
                A grimm versus a child, but this made her awaken her semblance, she could channel energy to her mussles
                and she managed to get away to sefety. The grimm was taken care of soon there after, but it didn't
                change the fact that her brother was gone. She swore not to lose anyone else to the grimm. So she
                enrolled at the huntsman accademy. When she moved to Haven she was meet with a harch reality, faunus
                kind wasn't welcome there. This resulted in constant bullying, mostly because of her tail, but also
                her eyes and hairstyle, being the same she always had. She talked to her parents about it but they
                recomended not to change it and the bullies were just immature. Later her parents got divorced
                it wasn't that big of a fight, but they couldn't agree on where to stay.

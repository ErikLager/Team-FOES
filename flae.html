                Flae Elurra is a member of team <abbr title="Forest">FOES</abbr>.

            <h1>Appearance</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                She is a girl of shorter statue with pale complexion and short messy red hair with a white streak
                on her left side, like her sister. She usually wears loose clothes as she doesn't really care 
                what she wears. They are however resistant to fire, due to her semblance. Her eyes are a faded 
                fire-orange color, due to her blindness, but her left eye has a nasty scar on it, from the
                time she lost her sight. She also has a fluffy orange fox tail. <!--The helpful fox Senko-san-->

            <h1>Personality</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                She has a very upbeat and cheery personality and will, when given the chance, pull a blindness joke
                to make sure everyone doesn't need to be afraid of offending her. This often leads to more relaxed
                convesations and she feels more comfortable. 
            </p>
            <h1>Backstory</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                When she was two she ran away from home and her dad found her after almost thirty
                minutes. When they were about to head home a grimm swooped out of nowhere and attacked Flae, 
                but her father managed to stop most of the attack, but she was thrown into a tree and knocked out.
                When she woke up she had lost her sight and dad, and her left eye was scared. It took some time
                before they realised how she had survived in the snow as this happened in late fall. But she eventually
                figured it out. She had awoken her semblance. She had the ability to heat up whatever she touched, so
                her semblance keep her body temperature high enougth to survive the freezing snow.

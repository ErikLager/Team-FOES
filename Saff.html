                Saff Meral <!--Saphirina Emeraldium --> is a member of team <abbr title="Forest">FOES</abbr>.
            </p>

            <h1>Appearance</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                She is a tall with a dark complexion and her hair is pulled back in dreadlocks.
                She's got dark brown eyes <!--That's a lie--> and a presents strong enough to intimidate 
                more or less anyone. She has two piercings in her ears, the right is a small blue gem and the 
                left is a small green gem. In clothing she wears a green crop top (for increased movement),
                this reveals a tattoo on her right shoulder. It's of her emblem, a dual toned shield in the
                same colors as her earrings. <!--and eyes and aura--> She has armor plates on her forearm, for 
                storage of more dust and extra protection. She also sports shorts, this also so her movement isn't hindered.
            </p>

            <h1>Personality</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                She has an will of steel. If she decides on anything, she will get it done. She also is very
                protective of things she cares about, this includes a gift from her father, a knife that was made 
                her great grandfather, who passed it to his son, who passed it to his son, who passed it to Saff. 
                She is also very protective of her team, often resorting to intimidation if she feels it's necessary
                and she will get physical if they try to attack. She know she's very big and strong so when not in 
                official combat, (like when someone at school bullies her teammates) she often tries to hold back,
                to not crack a skull or a spine or something similar.

            <h1>Backstory</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                She was born in Haven to the grandson of a legendary blacksmith and early on took a liking to the
                craft. When she was around six, she was in an accident at a storage house when she almost died to a dustcrate
                that fell down but she awakened her semblance at that moment, saving her life. <br>
                In school she was made fun of for being taller than anyone, including the boys. She eventually 
                managed to make a friend, but it turned out that person was only intrested in her height. This all changed
                when she met Flae. A blind girl who never knew her for her physical appearance.

                        <!-- Single edge small curve Just over 5" with a small handguard with the blade having a design of darker color of the steel in a seemingly random pattern (results in what looks like flowers and gemstones) [Inspired by Damascus]-->

            <h1>Weapons & Combat</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Her weapons are rings she wears on her fingers. The rings are infused with dust, to use in combination with
                her semblance. The rings contain: Fire dust on her index fingers and water dust on her middle fingers.
                On her left ring finger she has ice and her left pinky finger she has wind dust. Her right ring finger
                has gravity dust and her right pinky finger has electric dust. The aromr plating has even more fire
                and ice dust, as that's the most common type she'll run out of in combat. It also has some wind and electric
                dust as those are very convenient to have some extra of.<br><br>
                
                <b>Mora:</b> The knife passed down from her great grandfather. It's blade is long and with a slight curve.
                The appearance of the blade is not of common steel. It is of wavy patterns in two tones, one of common steel
                and one of darker tone steel. It is achieved by combining two different types of steel when forging. 
                It is a method her great grandfather came up with himself. While it doesn't automatically make the blade
                stronger, it does make it very beautiful. 
            </p>
            <h1>Semblance</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Her semblance is Construct. It allows her to menipulate the shape of dust and even to, when in a pinch
                find it in small patches under ground. This however, only usually results in an ammount too small
                for combat, but it could be enough to save her life. <br><br>
                In combat it's a different story. She can use her rings to generate a elemental ball of dust
                or slice at it like a sword to hurl at a target, or she can create physical manifestation 
                to attack in a physical way. Example is that she can make ice gloves, to hit enemies and
                even freeze parts of them. She can also create primitive weapons like swords and spears, but
                since they're made of dust, they're more effective as a simpler form.
